# Sometimes I need to get my dotfiles somewhere that doesn't have access to
# github. This assumes I've run ./install.sh locally. So here we go:

REMOTE_HOST="$1"

    REMOTE_HOST="$REMOTE_HOST:dotfiles/"

DOTFILES_BIN_LOCATION=$(readlink $HOME/bin)
DOTFILES_LOCATION=$(dirname "$DOTFILES_BIN_LOCATION")
